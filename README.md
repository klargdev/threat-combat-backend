### Notes:
- Ensure that the code blocks (with triple backticks) are on their own lines.
- The Markdown syntax uses headings (`#`, `##`), bullet points (`-`), code blocks (```` ``` ````), and fenced code blocks to format sections.
- Replace placeholder text (e.g., `your-username`, `your-email@example.com`) with your actual details.
- This README should render nicely in GitHub or any Markdown previewer.

Feel free to adjust the formatting or content further to match your style. Let me know if you need additional modifications!
